# Payroll System: Back-End SOLO Project

The Payroll System was created using Java, PostgreSQL to create and store my database, SQL for my queries, SpringBoot to connect the server to the database, and Postman for API testing.

I started by creating a flowchart as a visual representation of how the user interacts with the backend of the application. The first method created was to enable current adminstrators to login into the system. The admin team can then search up employees, calculate hours and work out employees tax percentage. 

The payroll system only enables the admin to access and update the employees in the database.
